# Bounty_Project_2

- This was a group project that utilized **MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and **Sequalize** with a **Model-View-Controller (MVC).** 

- My main responsibility was to collaboratively build the front end for this project.

- **Bounty** is an app that a user can post a task/errand that they want to have fulfilled by another individual that accepts the dollar amount posted(Bounty).

- **Heroku** is used to deploy the **Bounty Web Application.**

Once deployed, the app will display the landing page, and will allow the user to choose between two options: **"Create Bounty"** and **"Wanted."** 

**Below is a screenshot of the landing page.**
